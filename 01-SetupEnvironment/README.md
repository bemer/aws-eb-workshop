# Setup Environments

This section describes the hardware and software needed for this workshop, and how to configure them. This workshop is designed for a BYOL (Brying Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.


## Hardware & Software

- Memory: At least 4 GB+, strongly preferred 8 GB
- Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10.3+), Windows 10 Pro+ 64-bit, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+.

> NOTE: An older version of the operating system may be used. The installation instructions may differ slightly in that case and are explained in the next section.


## Install AWS CLI

During this workshop we will interact with some AWS API's. Having the latest version of the AWS CLI in your computer is appropriated.

Instructions to install the AWS CLI are available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html


## Install git

Sometimes will be easier if you just clone this repo, instead of copying the files. Having the git installed is not a mandatory requisite, but it may help you.

Download and install here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
You can have more information about git here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started


## The Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI)

The EB CLI is a command line interface for Elastic Beanstalk that provides interactive commands that simplify creating, updating and monitoring environments from a local repository. Use the EB CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console.

You will find the instructions to install the EB CLI in this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html
