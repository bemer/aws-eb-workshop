# Welcome to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Hands-On lab

Hello and welcome to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Hands-On lab! Before starting this labs, there are a few things that you should know:

## 1) It's all about Elastic Beanstalk!

We will walk you through the very basics of Elastic Beanstalk: from installing and configuring the applications needed in your machine, deploying your applications in an Elastic Beanstalk Environment and creating a CI/CD pipeline.

## 2) Let's use the CLI

Everything that we wil be doing in these labs can be also done in the web interface, but our main focus today is to use the EB CLI tool.

## 3) If you are using a Windows machine...

We strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even tested in Windows environments.

## 4) Enough of jibber jabber...

Go sharp your Elastic Beanstalk skills and take over the world.
